# Telegram bot
Hi there, here is my first telegram bot.

How to use?
For using bot you should create .env file in the root folder. (or in debug?)


.env should looks like:

TGBOTAPI=***

CURRENCYAPI=***

TRANSLATEAPI=***


where *** - is your api tokens for:

1)TGBOTAPI - telegram bot token which gives you BotFather

2)CURRENCYAPI - currencylayer api

3)TRANSLATEAPI - google translate api (F12 on other language site --> Network --> search word "key" --> RMB on site --> translate --> in request url you can see key you needed before &logld)

for now thats all
